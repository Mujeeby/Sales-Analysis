# Sales-Analysis 



This Power BI project explores key insights from a fictional retail dataset to support business decision-making across sales performance, customer behavior, and product profitability.

## Project Overview

The dashboard visualizes sales data across multiple dimensions, answering core business questions such as:

- Which product lines generate the most revenue?
- How does customer type (Member vs. Normal) impact sales?
- What time of day sees the highest purchase volume?
- How do payment methods influence sales averages?
- How do branches differ in product profitability?
